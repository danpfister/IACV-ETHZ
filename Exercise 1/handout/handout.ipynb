Due to the wide interest in the championship, you want to share the live games on internet. Thus, you plan to record the games using an external camera, and transmit it. Your friend from mechanical engineering has already agreed to help you with the camera setup. Unfortunately, being a poor student, you can only afford a cheap camera which provides you noisy images. To make the matter worse, your internet connection is poor and hence you cannot transmit the full images directly due to large file size. Thankfully, you are currently taking a computer vision course :) Thus you decide to use your newly acquired knowledge to design a software which can i) compress the images obtained from the camera for efficient transmission, and ii) reconstruct the compressed images on the client side to generate a high quality, noise free, output. An overview of the entire pipeline is shown in Figure.\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1GSONZLYDWt0OxmbzdVNIXR8evSSTODco)\n","\n","**Details about the setup**\n","* The camera is placed exactly about the console screen. Both the console, and the camera are rigidly placed, i.e. they do not move. Furthermore, the screen is always fully visible in the camera and we do not have any other object, e.g. hand entering the camera view.\n","* The actual game image $x$ (the one displayed on the console screen) is a discrete RGB image of size 96 x 96. Each pixel in the image is an integer which can take values between [0, 255]. In fact, the pixels at each location in the image can take only one of 4 values, white for the background region, black for the grid lines, red for the X sign, and green for the O sign.\n","* The camera provides you an RGB image $\\hat{x}$ of size 96 x 96 which is corrupted by noise. Each pixel in the image is a 32-bit floating-point number which can take any continuous value between [0.0, 255.0].  Note that due to the presence of noise, the pixels in the camera image can take any continuous value, even though pixels in the original image only have discrete integral values.\n","\n","\n","In order to design your compression algorithm, you have access to a dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{train} = \\{\\hat{x}_i\\}_{i=1}^{100}$ containing 100 noisy images captured using the exact same camera setup. You can use this dataset to learn codebook $\\mathcal{C}$ which you use for compression. For instance, if you use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach for compression, the codebook $\\mathcal{C}$ will contain the first $K$ principal components, as well as the mean image. Given a new image $\\hat{x}_j$ from a game, and the learnt codebook $\\mathcal{C}$, your compression algorithm should output a compressed representation $z_j = \\texttt{Compress}(\\hat{x}_j, \\mathcal{C})$, which is smaller in size compared to $\\hat{x}_j$. Finally, you should also provide a reconstruction algorithm which can recover an estimate $x^{pred}_j = \\texttt{Reconstruct}(z_j, \\mathcal{C})$ of the **original** clean image $x_j$ given the compressed version $z_j$ and the codebook $\\mathcal{C}$.\n","\n","For debugging purposes, we also provde a validation dataset containing 50 noisy images, as well as the clean ground truth for each of these images.\n","\n","**Evaluation Criteria**\n","\n","Your method will be evaluated using three criterias, namey the size of the codebook, the compression ability and the reconstruction quality. For evaluation, you are provided with a test dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{test} = \\{\\hat{x}_j\\}_{j=1}^{50}$ containing 50 noisy images. Your method should output i) the compressed representations $z_j$ for each of the test images, ii) the codebook $\\mathcal{C}$ employed for compression, and iii) the reconstructed version $x^{pred}_j$ for each of the test images. **Note** that both your codebook $\\mathcal{C}$, as well as the compressed representations $z_j$ are **required** to be Numpy arrays. The codebook size, the mean compressed size, and the mean reconstruction error are then computed as follows,\n","\n","$$ \\text{CodebookSize} = \\texttt{Size}(\\mathcal{C})$$\n","$$ \\text{MeanCompressedSize} = \\frac{1}{50}\\sum_{j=1}^{50} \\texttt{Size}(z_j) $$\n","$$ \\text{MeanReconError} = \\frac{1}{100}\\sum_{j=1}^{100} \\|x^{pred}_j - x_j\\|_2 $$\n","\n","Here, $\\|.\\|_2$ denotes the $\\mathcal{L}_2$ norm. That is, it computes the root mean squared error between the pixel values of predicted image and the ground truth image over the full image. The $\\texttt{Size}$ function computes the size of the input NumPy arrays based on their shape and data types, in terms of bytes. For instances, if your codebook $\\mathcal{C}$ is a Numpy array of datatype $\\texttt{uint8}$ and shape $50 \\times 50 \\times 3$, then $\\texttt{Size}(\\mathcal{C}) = 50*50*3*1$. Please refer to the evaluation script included in this notebook (`evaluation.py`) for more details.\n","\n","The final evaluation score is obtained as the weighted sum of each of these individual scores,\n","\n","$$ \\text{EvaluationScore} = \\text{MeanReconError} + \\frac{1}{10^6}\\text{CodebookSize} + \\frac{1}{10}\\text{MeanCompressedSize} $$\n","\n","**Passing requirement**\n","\n","To pass this exercise your EvaluationScore has to be lower than the score submitted by IACV_BASELINE to the evaluation server.\n","The link to the evaluation server can be found on Moodle."],"id":"0a2b93c6-5a14-49ce-97c7-6f0046875a1c"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d1efc561-5909-4948-afba-28a0bdc296e3"},"source":["## Initialize the environment and load data\n","Import the necessary libraries.
